Generally, we use this information to help us improve this Site (for example, by making it more compatible with the technology used by our visitors) and to improve our marketing efforts (for example, by identifying your general geographic location). However, we may combine it with other information in an attempt to identify you or we may combine it with information that does identify you. We may also review our server logs for security purposes - for example, to detect intrusions into our network - and we might share our server logs, which contain visitors' IP addresses, with the appropriate investigative authorities who could use that information to trace and identify you.</p>

      <h4>More about IP addresses</h4>
      <p>Your IP address is the identifier assigned to your particular computer or other device when you access the Internet. Depending on how you connect to the Internet, your IP address may always be the same, or it may change each time you access the Internet. IP addresses do not include your name, email address or other personal information, but in some cases, they may be linked to your personal information. For example, if you have registered with this Site, we may link your IP address to account information that identifies you personally. We may also provide your IP address to our third-party service providers who can use it to identify information such as your state and zip code. If we suspect inappropriate or criminal activity or a threat to our Sites or their users, we may also share our server logs - which contain users' IP addresses - with the appropriate investigative authorities, who could use that information to trace and identify individuals.</p>

      <h4>Clickstream Data</h4>
      <p>As you use the Internet, a trail of electronic information is left at each website you visit. This information, which is sometimes referred to as “clickstream data,” can be collected and stored by a website's server. Clickstream data can tell us the type of device and browsing software you use and the address of the website from which you linked to the Site. We may collect and use clickstream data to anonymously determine how much time visitors spend on websites, how visitors navigate throughout websites and how we may tailor our Site to better meet consumer needs. This information will be used to improve our Site and our services. Any collection or use of clickstream data will be anonymous and will not intentionally contain any personal data.</p>

      <h4>Information from Your Mobile or Tablet Device</h4>
      <p>Likewise, if you access this Site through your mobile or tablet device, we may automatically collect certain information from or about your device. The types of information we may collect include the type of device you use, the IP address of your device, your device's operating system, the type of mobile or tablet Internet browsers you use, and information about the way you use our mobile or tablet application.

      <h4>Information Collected by Cookies and Other Technologies</h4>
      <p>We use “cookies” and other technologies to collect information and support certain features of this Site. For example, we may use these technologies to:</p>

As you browse this Site, our web server will recognize your zip code and show you products and services available in your area. The information we collect using cookies and similar technologies is not, in and of itself, personally identifiable, but we may link it to personal information that you provide.

      <h3>Interest Based Advertising</h3>

      <p>We may ourselves, or with third party vendors, use non-personal information in connection with our own or vendor information to deliver targeted advertising to you when you visit other websites or our Site. Cookies, clickstream data, and other similar technologies described above may be used in this process. For example, if you are searching for information on a particular product, we or our vendor may cause an advertisement to appear on other websites you view with information on that product. This form of advertising, sometimes called “behavioral advertising,” is based on anonymous information and not on any personal information. As a result, we and our vendor know your interests, but do not personally identify you in connection with the delivery of that specific ad. We believe that such advertising is helpful because you will see advertisements that are relevant to your interests. However, if you would like to opt out of these interest-based advertisements, please follow the opt-out process described below under “Your Choices.”</p>
      
      <h3>Your Choices</h3>

You can opt-out of targeted advertising from certain providers at www.aboutads.info/consumers. Please note that by opting out, you will continue to see generic advertising that is not tailored to your specific interests and activities.

For example, if you have opted out on your device browser, that opt-out will not be effective on your mobile device. You must separately opt out on each device.</p>

      <h4>Opting Out of Cookies</h4>
      <p>If you want to stop or restrict the placement of cookies or flush any cookies that may already be on your computer or device, please refer to and adjust your web browser preferences.
